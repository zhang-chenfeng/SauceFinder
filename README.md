# SauceFinder
*Everyone else is creating apps to solve crazy problems and improve the world. So here is a script to get hentai*

This program will accept your 6 digit number(s) and generate a preview corresponding to the respective gallery number of a certain website that begins with the letter 'n'


### TODO
- [x] Image preview
- [x] Display tags correctly
- [x] Balance GUI (partially done, more improvements in future)
- [x] data fetch on a seperate thread so the gui doesn't freeze if your internet sucks
- [x] general code improvements
- [x] full image previews maybe
- [ ] downloading & saving?
- [x] probably some sort of input validation but anything wrong should just return 404
- [ ] some sort of catch for connection timeout so it doesn't hang forever
- [x] add clicking support of the viewer
- [x] image downloading in backgrounds
- [ ] put comments so people can actually read my spageti
