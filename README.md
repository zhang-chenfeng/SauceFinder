### TODO
- [x] Image preview
- [x] Display tags correctly
- [x] Balance GUI (partially done, more improvements in future)
- [x] data fetch on a seperate thread so the gui doesn't freeze if your internet sucks
- [x] general code improvements
- [x] full image previews maybe
- [x] downloading & saving?
- [x] probably some sort of input validation but anything wrong should just return 404
- [x] some sort of catch for connection timeout so it doesn't hang forever
